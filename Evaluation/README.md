# Evaluating the data collected with WISE

## About

**N.B.:** if you reached this part of the repository via a direct link, please note that this 
sub-folder doesn't provide the data collected by `WISE`. You will rather find it in the 
*Dataset/* sub-folder located at the root of this repository.

This part of the repository provides several sub-folders containing scripts to plot various 
figures showing the accuracy of measured subnets, the persistence of subnets or the extent of the 
obstacles for subnet inference (i.e. flickering IPs, warping IPs and echoing IPs). Each sub-folder 
provides the figures we generated for the currently available data as well. Two additional 
sub-folders also provide some details on how to validate `WISE` and compare it to both 
`ExploreNET` and `TreeNET` and on how to validate/evaluate its neighborhoods (with version 1.1 and 
onwards).

Each sub-folder comes with the scripts (+ instructions) and additional sub-folders providing all 
generated figures. Sub-folders are typically named after the start/end dates of the campaign from 
which they were generated.
