# Evaluating the data collected with WISE

*By Jean-Fran√ßois Grailet (last updated: February 25, 2019)*

## About

This part of the repository provides several sub-folders containing scripts to plot various 
figures showing the accuracy of measured subnets, the persistence of subnets or the extent of the 
obstacles for subnet inference (i.e. flickering IPs, warping IPs and echoing IPs). Each sub-folder 
provides the figures we generated for the currently available data as well. A final sub-folder 
also provides some details on how to validate `WISE` and compare it to both `ExploreNET` and 
`TreeNET`.

Each sub-folder comes with the scripts (+ instructions) and additional sub-folders providing all 
generated figures. Sub-folders are typically named after the start/end dates of the campaign from 
which they were generated.
