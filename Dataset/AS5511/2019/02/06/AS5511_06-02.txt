--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 126 target IPs per thread).
28657 out of 31971 IPs with an estimated TTL (89.6344%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 153 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 289 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS5511_06-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 3 aliases.
