--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 125 target IPs per thread).
11453 out of 31979 IPs with an estimated TTL (35.8141%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 83 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 300 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS5511_11-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 4 aliases.
