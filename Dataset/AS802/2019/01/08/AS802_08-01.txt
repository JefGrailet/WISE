--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 241 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1401 out of 7454 IPs with an estimated TTL (18.7953%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 25 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 142 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS802_08-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
