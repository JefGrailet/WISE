--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 226 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1318 out of 7094 IPs with an estimated TTL (18.5791%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 24 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 130 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS802_13-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of one alias.
Now starting alias hints collection...
Collecting hints for 130.63.2.2, 130.63.2.62, 130.63.9.98... Done.
Resolving... Done.
