--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 3007 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 12 additional responsive IPs.

Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 3019

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_04-12.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 95 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
841 out of 2978 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.2404%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 17 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 107 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
