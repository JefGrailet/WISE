Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS286_02-12.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 95 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
865 out of 3007 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.7662%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 21 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 115 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
