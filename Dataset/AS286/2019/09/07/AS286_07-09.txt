--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 96 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
875 out of 3024 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.9352%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 19 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 123 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 6 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
