--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 97 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
726 out of 3052 IPs with an estimated TTL (23.7877%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 18 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 87 target IPs per thread).
