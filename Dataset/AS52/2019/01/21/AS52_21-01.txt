--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 67 target IPs per thread).
7670 out of 14000 IPs with an estimated TTL (54.7857%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 130 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 152 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS52_21-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 28 aliases.
