--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 66 target IPs per thread).
8212 out of 14357 IPs with an estimated TTL (57.1986%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 132 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 322 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS52_14-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 31 aliases.
