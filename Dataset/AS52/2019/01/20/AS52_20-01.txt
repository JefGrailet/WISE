--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 61 target IPs per thread).
7363 out of 13378 IPs with an estimated TTL (55.0381%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 127 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 260 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS52_20-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 10 aliases.
