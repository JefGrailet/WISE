--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 68 target IPs per thread).
8375 out of 14481 IPs with an estimated TTL (57.8344%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 138 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 308 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS52_17-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 27 aliases.
