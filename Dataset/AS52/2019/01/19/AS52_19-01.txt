--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 61 target IPs per thread).
7485 out of 13462 IPs with an estimated TTL (55.601%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 135 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 271 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS52_19-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 6 aliases.
