--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 8046 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 4 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (22-11-2019 10:33:50) ---
Elapsed time: 47 minutes 18 seconds
Total amount of probes: 184466
Total amount of successful probes: 14456 (7.83667%)
Total amount of discovered responsive IPs: 8050

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_22-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 252 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2330 out of 8039 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.9837%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 33 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 277 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 12 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
