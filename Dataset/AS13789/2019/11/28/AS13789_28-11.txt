Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_28-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 252 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2239 out of 7992 IPs with an estimated TTL (28.0155%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 34 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 274 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
