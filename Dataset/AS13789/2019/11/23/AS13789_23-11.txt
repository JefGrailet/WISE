--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 251 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2371 out of 7995 IPs with an estimated TTL (29.656%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 27 threads will be scheduled (from 9 to 289 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
