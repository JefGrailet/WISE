Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_11-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 236 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1596 out of 7523 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.2149%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 29 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 136 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 12 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
