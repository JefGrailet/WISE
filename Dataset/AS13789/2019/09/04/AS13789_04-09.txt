--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7449 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 126 additional responsive IPs.

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_04-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 237 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1525 out of 7565 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.1586%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 31 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 119 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.
