--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 7525 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 6 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (13-09-2019 09:09:33) ---
Elapsed time: 47 minutes 42 seconds
Total amount of probes: 184987
Total amount of successful probes: 10573 (5.71554%)

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_13-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 236 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1627 out of 7521 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.6328%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 33 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 136 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 10 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
