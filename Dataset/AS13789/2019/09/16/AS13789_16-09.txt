Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_16-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 238 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1659 out of 7586 IPs with an estimated TTL (21.8692%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 30 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 135 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
