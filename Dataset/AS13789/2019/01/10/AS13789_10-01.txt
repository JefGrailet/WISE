Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_10-01.ips (temporar).
--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 245 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1503 out of 7814 IPs with an estimated TTL (19.2347%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 31 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 148 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS13789_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 10 aliases.
