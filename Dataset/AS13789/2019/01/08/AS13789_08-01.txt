--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 245 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1462 out of 7808 IPs with an estimated TTL (18.7244%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 31 threads will be scheduled (from 3 to 127 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS13789_08-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
