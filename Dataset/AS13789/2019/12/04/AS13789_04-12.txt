--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 8032 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 2 additional responsive IPs.
--- End of target pre-scanning (04-12-2019 15:11:41) ---
Elapsed time: 47 minutes 12 seconds

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS13789_04-12.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 252 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2371 out of 8023 IPs with an estimated TTL (29.5525%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 33 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 340 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
