--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 252 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2423 out of 8035 IPs with an estimated TTL (30.1556%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 38 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 243 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 12 aliases.
