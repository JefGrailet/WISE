--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 179 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
2164 out of 5714 IPs with an estimated TTL (37.8719%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 46 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 111 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS703_22-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 21 aliases.
