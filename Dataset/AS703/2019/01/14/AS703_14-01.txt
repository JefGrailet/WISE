Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 181 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
312 out of 5772 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.40541%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 11 threads will be scheduled (from 5 to 55 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS703_14-01.ips.
