Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS1241_22-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 517 target IPs per thread).
874 out of 124399 IPs with an estimated TTL (0.702578%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 25 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 61 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 8 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
