--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 514 target IPs per thread).
907 out of 121832 IPs with an estimated TTL (0.744468%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 25 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 78 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS1241_03-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 17 aliases.
