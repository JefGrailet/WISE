Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS1241_11-02.ips (temporar).
--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 511 target IPs per thread).
897 out of 121701 IPs with an estimated TTL (0.737052%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 25 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 62 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS1241_11-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 20 aliases.
