--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 256 threads will be scheduled (up to 674 target IPs per thread).
7073 out of 128937 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.48562%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 71 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 319 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 25 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
