Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6762_20-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 693 target IPs per thread).
7419 out of 133564 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.55464%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 75 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 483 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 21 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
