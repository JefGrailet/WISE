--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 706 target IPs per thread).
7150 out of 137023 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.2181%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 67 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 385 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 18 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
