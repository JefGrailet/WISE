Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6762_09-02.ips (temporar).
--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 589 target IPs per thread).
3659 out of 133054 IPs with an estimated TTL (2.75001%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 42 threads will be scheduled (from 10 to 445 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6762_09-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 19 aliases.
