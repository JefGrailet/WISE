--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 502 target IPs per thread).
3954 out of 123153 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.21064%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 42 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 492 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6762_24-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 21 aliases.
