--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 571 target IPs per thread).
4780 out of 134170 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.56264%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 51 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 415 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6762_27-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 23 aliases.
