Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6762_17-01.ips (temporar).
--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 331 target IPs per thread).
3032 out of 84545 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.58626%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 42 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 459 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6762_17-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 20 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
