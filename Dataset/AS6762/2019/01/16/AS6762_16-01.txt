--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 331 target IPs per thread).
2904 out of 84567 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.43396%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 39 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 438 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6762_16-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 18 aliases.
