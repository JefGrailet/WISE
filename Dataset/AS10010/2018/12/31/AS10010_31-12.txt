Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS10010_31-12.ips (temporar).
--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 338 target IPs per thread).
1274 out of 85350 IPs with an estimated TTL (1.49268%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 24 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 115 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS10010_31-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 10 aliases.
