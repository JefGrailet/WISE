--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 341 target IPs per thread).
1332 out of 86038 IPs with an estimated TTL (1.54815%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing n°1.
To do this, 27 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 124 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS10010_18-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 26 aliases.
