--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 341 target IPs per thread).
1270 out of 85930 IPs with an estimated TTL (1.47795%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing n°1.
To do this, 25 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 115 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS10010_20-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 23 aliases.
