--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 339 target IPs per thread).
1287 out of 85768 IPs with an estimated TTL (1.50056%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 27 threads will be scheduled (from 12 to 96 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS10010_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 27 aliases.
