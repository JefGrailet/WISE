--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 340 target IPs per thread).
983 out of 85711 IPs with an estimated TTL (1.14688%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 21 threads will be scheduled (from 12 to 105 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS10010_08-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 32 aliases.
