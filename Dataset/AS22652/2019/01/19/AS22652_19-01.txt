--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 260 threads will be scheduled (up to 54 target IPs per thread).
3568 out of 13480 IPs with an estimated TTL (26.4688%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 54 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 256 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS22652_19-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 4 aliases.
