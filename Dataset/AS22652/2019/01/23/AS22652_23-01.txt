--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 259 threads will be scheduled (up to 54 target IPs per thread).
9625 out of 13443 IPs with an estimated TTL (71.5986%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 131 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 270 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS22652_23-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 6 aliases.
