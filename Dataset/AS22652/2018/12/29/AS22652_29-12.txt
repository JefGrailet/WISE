--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 54 target IPs per thread).
4344 out of 13830 IPs with an estimated TTL (31.41%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 60 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 247 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS22652_29-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 4 aliases.
