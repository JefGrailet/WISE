--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 268 target IPs per thread).
7464 out of 61082 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.2196%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 78 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 484 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS224_21-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 30 aliases.
