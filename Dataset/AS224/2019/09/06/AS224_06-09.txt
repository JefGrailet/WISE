Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS224_06-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 326 target IPs per thread).
7197 out of 57267 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.5674%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 88 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 376 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 26 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
