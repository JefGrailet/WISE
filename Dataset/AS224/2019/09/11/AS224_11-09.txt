Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS224_11-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 351 target IPs per thread).
7227 out of 58546 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.3441%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 94 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 364 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 32 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
