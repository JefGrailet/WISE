--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 464 target IPs per thread).
53403 out of 118760 IPs with an estimated TTL (44.9672%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 256 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 411 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
