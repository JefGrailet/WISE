--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 452 target IPs per thread).
50909 out of 115523 IPs with an estimated TTL (44.0683%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 256 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 449 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8220_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 9 aliases.
