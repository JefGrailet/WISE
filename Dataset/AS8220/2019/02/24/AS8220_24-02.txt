--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 457 target IPs per thread).
51617 out of 116882 IPs with an estimated TTL (44.1616%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 256 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 442 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8220_24-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 10 aliases.
