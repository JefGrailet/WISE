Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS3257_30-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 1117 target IPs per thread).
11737 out of 284954 IPs with an estimated TTL (4.11891%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 144 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 397 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 45 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
