Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS12956_28-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 401 target IPs per thread).
3121 out of 102428 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.04702%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 43 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 433 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 25 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
