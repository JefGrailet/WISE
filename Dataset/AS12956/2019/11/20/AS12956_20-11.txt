--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 401 target IPs per thread).
3086 out of 102478 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.01138%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 42 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 428 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 27 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
