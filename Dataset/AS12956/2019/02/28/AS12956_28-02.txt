--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 443 target IPs per thread).
2323 out of 113332 IPs with an estimated TTL (2.04973%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 42 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 386 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS12956_28-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 29 aliases.
