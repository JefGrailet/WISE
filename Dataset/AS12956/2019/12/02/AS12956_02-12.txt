Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS12956_02-12.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 400 target IPs per thread).
3079 out of 102337 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.00869%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 52 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 435 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 18 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
