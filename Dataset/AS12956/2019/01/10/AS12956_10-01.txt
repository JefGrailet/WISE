--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 460 target IPs per thread).
2752 out of 117678 IPs with an estimated TTL (2.33858%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 52 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 326 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS12956_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 29 aliases.
