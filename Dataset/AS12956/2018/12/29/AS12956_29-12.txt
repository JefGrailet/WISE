--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 460 target IPs per thread).
9889 out of 117820 IPs with an estimated TTL (8.39331%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 55 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 493 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS12956_29-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 18 aliases.
