--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 293 target IPs per thread).
14496 out of 74727 IPs with an estimated TTL (19.3986%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 154 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 510 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6453_30-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 27 aliases.
