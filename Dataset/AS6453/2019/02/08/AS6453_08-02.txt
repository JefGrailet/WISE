--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 240 target IPs per thread).
1692 out of 61324 IPs with an estimated TTL (2.75912%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 29 threads will be scheduled (from 8 to 150 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6453_08-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 20 aliases.
