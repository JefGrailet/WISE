--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 51347 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 155 additional responsive IPs.

Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6453_20-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 201 target IPs per thread).
1970 out of 51382 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.83403%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 35 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 293 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 26 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
