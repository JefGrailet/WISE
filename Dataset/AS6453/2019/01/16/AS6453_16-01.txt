--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 293 target IPs per thread).
15540 out of 74625 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.8241%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 160 threads will be scheduled (from 5 to 501 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6453_16-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 28 aliases.
