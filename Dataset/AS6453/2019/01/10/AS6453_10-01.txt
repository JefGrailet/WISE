--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 292 target IPs per thread).
11480 out of 71243 IPs with an estimated TTL (16.1139%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 152 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 434 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6453_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 30 aliases.
