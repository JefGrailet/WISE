--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 293 target IPs per thread).
15193 out of 74717 IPs with an estimated TTL (20.3341%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 166 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 493 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6453_14-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 31 aliases.
