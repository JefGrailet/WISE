Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6453_13-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 238 target IPs per thread).
2032 out of 61017 IPs with an estimated TTL (3.33022%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 38 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 262 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 21 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
