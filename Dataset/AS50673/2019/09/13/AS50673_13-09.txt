--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 68 target IPs per thread).
2571 out of 17483 IPs with an estimated TTL (14.7057%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 21 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 362 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 21 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
