Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS50673_04-09.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 69 target IPs per thread).
4132 out of 17718 IPs with an estimated TTL (23.3209%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 26 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 398 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 16 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
