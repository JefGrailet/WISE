--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 259 threads will be scheduled (up to 67 target IPs per thread).
3197 out of 17283 IPs with an estimated TTL (18.4979%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 30 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 453 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 16 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
