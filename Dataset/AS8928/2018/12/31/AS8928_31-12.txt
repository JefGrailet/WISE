--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 152 target IPs per thread).
5229 out of 38429 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.6069%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 85 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 257 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8928_31-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 7 aliases.
