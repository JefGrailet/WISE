--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 152 target IPs per thread).
4906 out of 38177 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.8507%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 73 threads will be scheduled (from 8 to 295 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8928_30-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.
