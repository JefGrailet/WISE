--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 151 target IPs per thread).
5162 out of 38374 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.4518%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 77 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 326 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8928_05-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 5 aliases.
