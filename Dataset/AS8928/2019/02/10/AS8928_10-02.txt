--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 139 target IPs per thread).
4870 out of 35467 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.7311%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 63 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 314 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8928_10-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 7 aliases.
