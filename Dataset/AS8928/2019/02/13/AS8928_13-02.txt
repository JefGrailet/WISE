--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 140 target IPs per thread).
4823 out of 35477 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.5947%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 64 threads will be scheduled (from 18 to 349 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS8928_13-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 7 aliases.
