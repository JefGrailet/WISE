--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 258 threads will be scheduled (up to 141 target IPs per thread).
5317 out of 36003 IPs with an estimated TTL (14.7682%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 61 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 391 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 8 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
