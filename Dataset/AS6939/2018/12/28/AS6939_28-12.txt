--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 399 target IPs per thread).
11863 out of 101740 IPs with an estimated TTL (11.6601%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 153 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 440 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_28-12.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 11 aliases.
