--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 397 target IPs per thread).
9400 out of 101406 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.26967%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 144 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 317 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_12-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
