--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 398 target IPs per thread).
9553 out of 101385 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.4225%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 139 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 357 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_13-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 16 aliases.
