--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 398 target IPs per thread).
6736 out of 101360 IPs with an estimated TTL (6.64562%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 117 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 201 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_10-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
