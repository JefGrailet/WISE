--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 395 target IPs per thread).
9666 out of 100624 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.60606%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 161 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 355 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_16-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 23 aliases.
