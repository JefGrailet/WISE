--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 395 target IPs per thread).
12768 out of 100601 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.6917%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 163 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 427 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_24-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
