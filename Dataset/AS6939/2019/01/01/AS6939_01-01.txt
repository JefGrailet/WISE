--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 400 target IPs per thread).
15414 out of 102051 IPs with an estimated TTL (15.1042%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 171 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 321 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_01-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
