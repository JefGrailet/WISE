--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 381 target IPs per thread).
9514 out of 97374 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.77058%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 145 threads will be scheduled (from 4 to 444 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 19 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
