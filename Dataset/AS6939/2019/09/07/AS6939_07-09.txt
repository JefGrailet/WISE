--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 381 target IPs per thread).
9858 out of 97310 IPs with an estimated TTL (10.1305%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 155 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 361 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
