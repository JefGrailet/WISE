--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 382 target IPs per thread).
9183 out of 97458 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.42252%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 151 threads will be scheduled (from 2 to 332 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
