--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 381 target IPs per thread).
9734 out of 97352 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.99877%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 143 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 375 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 18 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
