--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 382 target IPs per thread).
8500 out of 97429 IPs with an estimated TTL (8.7243%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 137 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 405 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
