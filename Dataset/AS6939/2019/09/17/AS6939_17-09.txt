--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 380 target IPs per thread).
9491 out of 97167 IPs with an estimated TTL (9.76772%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 144 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 356 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 17 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
