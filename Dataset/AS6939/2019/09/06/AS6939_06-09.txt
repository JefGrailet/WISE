--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 381 target IPs per thread).
7789 out of 97286 IPs with an estimated TTL (8.00629%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 115 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 312 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 22 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
