--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 406 target IPs per thread).
12724 out of 103420 IPs with an estimated TTL (12.3032%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 172 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 502 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_08-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
