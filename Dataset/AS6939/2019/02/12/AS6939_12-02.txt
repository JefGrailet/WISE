--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 406 target IPs per thread).
12050 out of 103516 IPs with an estimated TTL (11.6407%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 169 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 469 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_12-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 13 aliases.
