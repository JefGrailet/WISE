--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 407 target IPs per thread).
14746 out of 103843 IPs with an estimated TTL (14.2003%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 179 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 451 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_24-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
