--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 406 target IPs per thread).
13516 out of 103530 IPs with an estimated TTL (13.0552%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 176 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 455 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS6939_09-02.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
