Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6939_20-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 386 target IPs per thread).
5550 out of 98649 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.62601%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 99 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 373 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
