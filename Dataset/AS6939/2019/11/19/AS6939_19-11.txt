--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 98428 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 288 additional responsive IPs.

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 385 target IPs per thread).
5575 out of 98280 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.67257%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 98 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 350 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 15 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
