--- Start of target pre-scanning ---
Pre-scanning with initial timeout... done.
Found a total of 98625 responsive IPs.
Second opinion with twice the timeout (5sec : 0micsec)... done.
Found a total of 353 additional responsive IPs.

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 386 target IPs per thread).
5695 out of 98621 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.77463%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 93 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 460 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
