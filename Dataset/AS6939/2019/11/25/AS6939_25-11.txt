--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 386 target IPs per thread).
5698 out of 98663 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.77521%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 100 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 390 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 16 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
