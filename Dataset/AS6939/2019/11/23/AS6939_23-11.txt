--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 386 target IPs per thread).
5807 out of 98663 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.88569%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 102 threads will be scheduled (from 5 to 404 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 17 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
