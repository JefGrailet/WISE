Filtered target IPs have been saved in an output file AS6939_26-11.ips (temporar).

--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 257 threads will be scheduled (up to 386 target IPs per thread).
5783 out of 98588 IPs with an estimated TTL (5.86583%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 102 threads will be scheduled (from 4 to 403 target IPs per thread).

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 14 aliases.
Now starting alias hints collection...
