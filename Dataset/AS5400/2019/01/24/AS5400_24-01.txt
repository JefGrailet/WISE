--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 262 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1288 out of 8061 IPs with an estimated TTL (15.9782%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 28 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 149 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS5400_24-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 16 aliases.
