--- Start of target scanning ---
Starting the estimation of distance of all target IPs (in TTL).
To do this, 256 threads will be scheduled (up to 32 target IPs per thread).
1217 out of 7966 IPs with an estimated TTL (15.2774%) need to be re-probed to improve trails.
Starting re-probing target IPs with incomplete trails.
Starting re-probing nÂ°1.
To do this, 27 threads will be scheduled (from 1 to 106 target IPs per thread).
Updated IP dictionary has been saved in the output file AS5400_16-01.ips.

There are flickering IPs that could lead to the discovery of 12 aliases.
